\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Motivation}
\begin{frame}
	\scriptsize
	\begin{block}{In the earlier work}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item <1-> Focus on a system of partial differential equations which couples a kinetic equation to a macroscopic flow equation. This system model (given by Helzel $\&$ Tzavaras) a sedimentation process in suspension of rigid rod-like particles.
			\item <2-> Study the coupled system on $S^1$
			\item <3-> Construction a lower-dimensional model by using a hierarchy of moment equations
			\item <4-> The moment equations are a hyperbolic system with a source term
			\begin{align*}
				\partial_t Q(x,t) + A\partial_x Q(x,t) = \phi(Q(x,t))
		    \end{align*}
			The update of the source term is equivalent to a spectral method (\cite{doi:10.1137/21M1464592}).
		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}
	\begin{block}{General about the project}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item <5->  Study the coupled system on $S^2$, which is a five dimensional problem (plus time)
			\item <6-> Reduction of the higher-dimensional model by a three-dimensional system of partial differential equations
		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}
	\begin{block}{First step}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item <7-> Derive a spectral Method for the Smoluchowski Equation on $S^2$
			\item <8-> 
		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}
